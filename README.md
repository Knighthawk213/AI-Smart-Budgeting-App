streamlit run ai_smart_budgeting_app_full_stack_streamlit_app.py
\\\`

**Required Dependencies:**
- streamlit — Web framework for the UI
- pandas, numpy — Data manipulation and analysis
- scikit-learn — Machine learning models and preprocessing
- plotly, matplotlib — Data visualization
- xgboost, joblib — Advanced ML models and serialization

### Frontend (Flutter Mobile App)

**Prerequisites:**
- Flutter SDK (>=3.0.0, <4.0.0)
- Android Studio / Xcode (for emulator/device testing)

**Installation:**

\\\`bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on emulator or connected device
flutter run
\\\`

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Web Frontend** | Streamlit + Plotly | Interactive dashboards & visualizations |
| **Mobile Frontend** | Flutter (Dart) | Cross-platform mobile app |
| **Backend Logic** | Python + scikit-learn | ML model training & predictions |
| **ML Models** | Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost | Savings prediction algorithms |
| **Data Processing** | Pandas, NumPy | Data cleaning & feature engineering |
| **Clustering** | KMeans | User segmentation analysis |
| **Visualization** | Plotly, Matplotlib | Interactive & static charts |

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Via Streamlit Web App

**Smart Prediction** — Make predictions:
   - Enter your financial details (income, expenses, dependents, etc.)
   - Get instant savings estimates and financial health score
   - View expense distribution radar chart
   - Receive AI-powered budget recommendations

### Flutter App Integration

The Flutter app (budget_optimizer) opens a WebView to the Streamlit app and passes user inputs as URL query parameters:

\\\`
https://your-streamlit-app.com/?Income=50000&Age=28&Rent=15000&...
\\\`

The Streamlit app automatically processes these parameters and runs predictions without requiring manual input.

---

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Data Loading**: App loads \`Expense_data_cleaned.csv\` and aggregates potential savings columns
2. **Model Training**: Multiple ML models are trained on 80% of the data using StandardScaler normalization
3. **Prediction**: User inputs are scaled and passed through the best-performing model
4. **Analysis**: 
   - KMeans clustering segments users into 3 spending profiles
   - AI recommendation engine suggests cost reductions for above-average categories
5. **Visualization**: Results displayed via interactive Plotly gauges, radar charts, and bar graphs
